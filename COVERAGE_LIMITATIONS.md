# Coverage Limitations

This document details what legal sources are **NOT** included in this Tool and the impact on legal research completeness.

---

## Executive Summary

**This Tool is Incomplete** -- Critical legal sources are missing.

**Major Gaps:**
1. **Regional Legislation** -- Laws of subjects of the Russian Federation are not included
2. **Court Decisions** -- No court practice (sudebnaya praktika), Constitutional Court rulings, or Supreme Court explanatory notes
3. **Historical Statute Versions** -- Limited availability of provision wording over time
4. **Legal Commentary** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
5. **Subordinate Legislation** -- Limited coverage of ministerial orders and agency regulations
6. **International Treaties** -- Limited coverage of international agreements ratified by Russia

**Impact**: Professional legal research using this Tool **will miss critical authorities** and must be supplemented with additional sources.

## 1. Regional Legislation (Critical Gap)

### What's Missing

Russia is a federal state with 89 subjects (regions). Each subject has its own legislation:

- **Regional laws** (zakony sub'ektov RF)
- **Regional constitutions/charters** (konstitutsii/ustavy sub'ektov)
- **Municipal regulations** (munitsipal'nye normativnye akty)

**Status in This Tool**: Not Included

**Why It Matters:**
- Many legal issues require both federal and regional law analysis
- Regional laws may provide additional protections or requirements
- Some areas (housing, land use, social welfare) are heavily regulated at the regional level
- Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other major jurisdictions have extensive regional legislation

### Workaround

**Official Sources:**
- pravo.gov.ru (includes some regional legislation)
- Regional government official websites
- ConsultantPlus and Garant (comprehensive regional coverage)

---

## 2. Court Decisions (Critical Gap)

### What's Missing

**Courts NOT Covered:**
- **Constitutional Court of the RF** (Konstitutsionnyi Sud RF) -- binding interpretations
- **Supreme Court of the RF** (Verkhovnyi Sud RF) -- cassation decisions and explanatory notes (postanovleniya Plenuma)
- **Arbitrazh courts** (commercial courts at all levels)
- **Courts of general jurisdiction** (district, regional, appellate)

**Status in This Tool**: Not Included

**Why It Matters:**
- Postanovleniya Plenuma of the Supreme Court are de facto binding and essential for interpreting statutes
- Constitutional Court decisions can invalidate statutory provisions
- Court practice fills gaps in legislation and provides practical interpretation
- Without court decisions, statutory interpretation may be incomplete or incorrect

### Workaround

**Official Sources:**
- kad.arbitr.ru (arbitrazh court decisions database)
- sudrf.ru (courts of general jurisdiction)
- ksrf.ru (Constitutional Court)
- vsrf.ru (Supreme Court)
- ConsultantPlus, Garant (comprehensive court practice databases)

---

## 3. Historical Statute Versions (Significant Gap)

### What's Missing

**Historical Provision Wording**: Provisions as they existed on specific dates in the past.

**Example:**
- **Current (2026)**: Federal Law 152-FZ has been amended numerous times since 2006
- **Historical (2020)**: What did Article 9 say on 2020-06-15?

**Status in This Tool**:
- Limited: Only current text is available
- No systematic tracking of amendments over time

### Why Historical Versions Matter

- **Transitional law issues**: Which version applies to events that occurred in the past?
- **Contract interpretation**: Law at time of contract formation may differ from current law
- **Academic research**: Tracking legislative evolution

### Workaround

- **ConsultantPlus**: Comprehensive historical versions with date-specific lookup
- **Garant**: Historical redactions available
- **pravo.gov.ru**: Some historical versions available

## 4. Legal Commentary and Annotations (Critical for Professional Use)

### What's Missing

- Academic articles and treatises
- Practitioner guides and handbooks
- Editorial annotations explaining application
- Commentaries to codes (kommentarii k kodeksam)
- Practice notes and cross-references

**Status in This Tool**: Not Included -- Plain statutory text only

### Why Commentary Matters

Russian legal practice relies heavily on:
- **Kommentarii k kodeksam** -- multi-volume commentaries on each code
- **Postanovleniya Plenuma** -- Supreme Court explanatory notes (quasi-legislative)
- **Academic doctrine** -- influential in court reasoning
- **Ministerial clarifications** -- interpretive guidance

Without commentary, statutory text alone is often insufficient for professional legal work.

### Workaround

- **ConsultantPlus**: Extensive commentary and cross-references
- **Garant**: Professional annotations
- **Published commentaries**: Specialized code commentaries (e.g., Braginskii/Vitrianskii on Civil Code)

---

## 5. Subordinate Legislation (Significant Gap)

### What's Missing

- **Presidential decrees** (ukazy Prezidenta RF) -- limited coverage
- **Government resolutions** (postanovleniya Pravitelstva RF) -- limited coverage
- **Ministerial orders** (prikazy ministerstv) -- not included
- **Central Bank regulations** (normativnye akty Banka Rossii) -- not included
- **FSTEC/FSB security requirements** -- not included

**Status in This Tool**: Not Included

### Why It Matters

Federal laws frequently delegate implementation details to subordinate legislation. For example:
- 152-FZ delegates data protection technical requirements to FSTEC orders
- Tax Code delegates specific rates and procedures to government resolutions
- Labor Code delegates safety standards to ministerial orders

---

## 6. International Treaties (Gap)

### What's Missing

- **EAEU (Eurasian Economic Union) law** -- customs, trade, competition
- **CIS agreements** -- Commonwealth of Independent States treaties
- **UN conventions** ratified by Russia
- **European Convention on Human Rights** (Russia's membership suspended)
- **Bilateral treaties** -- investment protection, legal assistance

**Status in This Tool**: Minimal (EAEU Customs Code stub only)

## Summary: What This Tool Is NOT

- **NOT a complete legal research platform**
- **NOT a substitute for ConsultantPlus/Garant/commercial databases**
- **NOT comprehensive without court practice integration**
- **NOT authoritative for professional legal work without verification**
- **NOT a replacement for reading commentary and doctrine**

**This Tool Is:**
- A **starting point** for legal research
- A **supplement** to professional databases
- A **rapid lookup** tool for known citations
- An **open-source alternative** for preliminary research

**Golden Rule**: Use this Tool as **one source among many**, not the sole basis for legal conclusions.
